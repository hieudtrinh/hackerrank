Code Optimization
UPDATE: Thanks to @dietpepsi we further improved from 17ms to 15ms.

59ms: Use search and startsWith in Trie class like this popular solution.
33ms: Remove Trie class which unnecessarily starts from root in every dfs call.
30ms: Use w.toCharArray() instead of w.charAt(i).
22ms: Use StringBuilder instead of c1 + c2 + c3.
20ms: Remove StringBuilder completely by storing word instead of boolean in TrieNode.
20ms: Remove visited[m][n] completely by modifying board[i][j] = '#' directly.
18ms: check validity, e.g., if(i > 0) dfs(...), before going to the next dfs.
17ms: De-duplicate c - a with one variable i.
15ms: Remove HashSet completely. dietpepsi's idea is awesome.
The final run time is 15ms. Hope it helps!
