Task Description
A financial analyst is responsible for a portfolio of profitable stocks
represented in an array. Each item in the array represents the yearly
profit of a corresponding stock. The analyst gathers all distinct pairs
of stocks that reached the target profit. Distinct pairs are pairs that
differ in at least one element. Given the array of profits, find the
number of distinct pairs of stocks where the sum of each pair's profits
is exactly equal to the target profit.

Example
stocksProfit = [5,7,9,13,11,6,6,3,3]
target = 12 profit's target
- There are 4 pairs of stocks that have the sum of their profits equals
  to the target 12. Note that because there are two instances of 3 in
  stocksProfit there are two pairs matching(9,3): stocksProfits indices
  2 and 7, and indices 2 and 8, but only one can be included.
- There are 3 distinct pairs of stocks: (5,7), (3,9), and (6,6) and the
  return value is 3.

Function Description
Complete the function stockPairs in the editor below.

stockPairs has the following parameter(s):
    int stocksProfit[n]: an array of integers representing the stocks
    profits
    target: an integer representing the yearly target profit

Returns:
    int: the total number of pairs determined

Constrains
- 1 <= n <= 5 x 10^5
- 0 <= stocksProfit[i] <= 10^9
- 0 <= target <= 5 x 10^9

Input Format for Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.
The first line contains an integer n, the size of the array stocksProfit.
The next n lines each contain an element stocksProfit[i] where 0 <= i < n.
The next line contains an integer target, the target value.

Sample Input 0
STDIN       Function
6   ->      stocksProfit[] size n = 6
1   ->      stocksProfit = [1, 3, 46, 1, 3, 9]

Explanation 0
There are 4 pairs where stocksProfit[i] + stocksProfit[j] = 47
1. (stocksProfit[0]=1, stocksProfit[2]=46)
2. (stocksProfit[2]=46, stocksProfit[0]=1)
3. (stocksProfit[2]=46, stocksProfit[3]=1)
4. (stocksProfit[3]=1, stocksProfit[2]=46)

Since all four pairs contain the same values, there is only 1 distinct pair
of stocks: (1,46)


Sample Input 1
n = 7
stocksProfit = [6,6,3,9,3,5,1]
target = 12

Sample Output 1
2
